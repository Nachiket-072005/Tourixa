        <h2>About Tourixaa</h2>
        <p>
          Tourixaa isnâ€™t just a travel company â€” itâ€™s a passport to unforgettable memories.
          Weâ€™re here to flip the script on ordinary vacations and turn your trips into stories worth retelling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're dreaming of a peaceful sunset in Santorini, a bustling street market in Bangkok, or a quiet hilltop in Himachal,
          we help make it happen â€” your way. Since our beginning, weâ€™ve focused on <strong>customized, thoughtful travel experiences</strong> that go far beyond basic itineraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded by passionate explorers, Tourixaa started with a simple belief: <em>travel should feel personal, not packaged</em>.
          Today, we help travelers across the world plan everything from romantic honeymoons to adventure treks, family getaways to business trips â€” and everything in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our signature? A blend of modern tech (hello <strong>AR/VR previews</strong>!) and old-school care (yes, real humans who listen). 
          Oh, and great deals â€” because smart travel should also be smartly priced.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Tourixaa, we believe every trip is a chance to discover something new â€” about the world, and maybe even about yourself.
          Wherever youâ€™re headed, weâ€™ll help you get there in style.
